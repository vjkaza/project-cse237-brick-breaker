# BrickBreaker #

## Description ##

BrickBreaker is a 2D game where the player must deflect a bouncing ball with a paddle to hit and break bricks. The paddle moves horizontally, and the player loses if the ball slips past the paddle. When all the bricks have been broken, the player can advance to a harder level. The bricks get progressively harder to break.

## Iteration 1 ##

What user stories were completed this iteration?

	In this iteration, we completed the basic functionality of BrickBreaker by setting up a game board, paddle, ball, and bricks. In addition, we also have a menu and highscore. The bricks can be colorized so the game aesthetic is appealing, and the menu/high score serves the purpose of easing the user into the game and giving them a goal to keep track of/surpass, respectively.

What user stories do you intend to complete next iteration?

	In the next iteration, we would like to satisfy users by introducing levels and special bricks. These bricks will have special abilities (such as requiring more hits before it breaks), so the user will feel challenged and entertained. They will be introduced in harder levels that the user can reach so that the user feels a sense of accomplishment. We may also plan to allow the user to customize the game, so that the bricks/ball/paddle will respond more sensitively and/or be given the user's color of choice.

Is there anything that you implemented but doesn't currently work?

	Special brick types. We also implemented the ability for the player to chose his paddle color but there is currently no prompt for them to do so.
